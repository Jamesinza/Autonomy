<h1>Autonomy</h1>

<p>
This project explores early attempts at building autonomous systems:
agents that observe, decide, act, and adapt over time with minimal
hand-crafted control.
</p>

<p>
While the full problem of autonomy extends well beyond this codebase,
the experiments surfaced useful patterns, failure modes, and design
constraints that continue to inform later work.
</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Agent loop construction</li>
  <li>Decision persistence and drift</li>
  <li>Early self-directed behavior experiments</li>
</ul>
